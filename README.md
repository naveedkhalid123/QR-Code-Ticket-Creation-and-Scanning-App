# QR-Code-Ticket-Creation-and-Scanning-App

A Python-based solution for generating and validating student tickets using QR codes.
This project includes two standalone applications:

QR Code Generation App – Create QR codes for students and store details in an Excel file.

QR Code Scanning App – Scan QR codes via webcam, verify registrations, and display validation messages.

Both applications feature modern GUIs built with PyQt5, and student data is efficiently managed with Pandas in Excel files.
